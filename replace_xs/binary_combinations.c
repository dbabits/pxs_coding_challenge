Task:
  You are given a string composed of only 1s, 0s, and Xs.
  Write a program that will print out every possible combination where you replace the X with both 0 and 1.

The algorithm works by alternating Xs and Ys, effectively doing binary add with carry. X is printed as 0 and Y as 1
It walks the string right-to-left,turning ALL Ys to Xs and (FIRST X to Y and print)
Example: (need -std=c99 for gcc ver 4.8.3 20140911(not reqd for 5.4.0)(var declaration inside for loop)
        gcc -g -std=c99 binary_combinations.c -o binary_combinations && ./binary_combinations 0X1XX
	
First, the string is printed with 0s in place of all Xs:                                      XX -> prints 00
Iteration 1: right X becomes Y, and the string is printed:                                    XY -> prints 01
Iteration 2: all Ys from right become Xs, and the next X becomes Y and the string is printed: YX -> prints 10 
Iteration 3: right X  becomes Y, and the string is printed:                                   YY -> prints 11
Iteration 4: all Ys from right become Xs, we are now at the left end of the string:           XX -> (no more prints)
Nothing is printed anymore and the original string has been restored with Xs  
Number of iterations = 2^number of Xs 

Big O: O(2^m*n), where m is the number of Xâ€™s in the string, and n is the length of the string
